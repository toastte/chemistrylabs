# chemistrylabs
These are some of my lab writeups for Sojka's high school chemistry. It's incomplete, partially because I accidentally deleted lab 2 at one point and also because I can't be bothered to digitize the labs that I wrote up on paper.

Use them wisely, don't blindly copy them please. I know chemistry is a pain, so I'm putting these here for use as a general guide. I would be surprised if someone from my school who's taking the class actually manages to find this.

have fun
